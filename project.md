## Report

The report comprises of at most 25 pages (including title and eventual table of contents). It must include one section per task, and address all data mining tasks addressed in the course. Specifically, if any of these tasks appear in the project track, make sure to focus on the following:


**Data understanding**
- An analysis of all variables, their relations, distributions, and quality
- An eventual feature imputation and/or selection
- The engineering of additional features, including the aforementioned analyses


**Clustering**
- A properly justified feature selection phase
- Tackling all clusternig families, exploring their respective hyperparameters
- An analysis of the best clusterings per family, including cluster description
- A comparison of the best clusterings per family


**Anomaly detection**
- A selection of outliers through appropriate algorithms
- An interpretation of such outliers
- An analysis of the impact of the outliers on the previously performed data understanding 


**Time series analysis**
- Appropriate representation choice for the task at hand


**Supervised learning**
- Feature selection
- Test different families of models
- Proper model validation, including both model performance and model complexity
- Comparison of the best models of each family


**Explainability**
- Justified selection of instances to explain
- Analysis of the explanations
