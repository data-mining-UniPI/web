# Modalities

The exam can be taken in one of two ways:

**Project track**
- Paper presentation (10% of the final score): scheduled at the end of the course
- Project (60% of the final score): to be delivered after the end of the course
- Oral exam (30% of the final score)

**Test track**
- Paper presentation (10% of the final score): scheduled at the end of the course
- Written exam (60% of the final score): to be delivered after the end of the course
- Oral exam (30% of the final score)

In both tracks, the paper presentation is *optional*. Note that **a passing grade for the project/written exam is required to be admitted to the oral exam**.
