# Modalities

The exam can be taken in one of two ways:

**Project track**
- Project (70% of the final score): to be delivered after the end of the course
- Oral exam (30% of the final score)

During the course, you will have some "Project presentation" sessions wherein you'll briefly (~3 minutes) present your work, and receive feedback from the lecturers. These sessions do *not* contribute to your grade.

**Written test track**
- Written exam (70% of the final score): to be delivered after the end of the course
- Oral exam (30% of the final score)

Note that **a passing grade for the project/written exam is required to be admitted to the oral exam**.


## Written exam
The written exam covers the whole program, and can include both theoretical questions and exercises.

## Project
Details on the project are indicated in [the dedicated page](/project).

# Groups
